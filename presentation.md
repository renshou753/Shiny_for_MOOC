Project Background
========================================================

Game of Thrones are plenty fascinating enough on their own, and have infuriated viewers and readers alike for years now. The things is, no character, good or bad, major or minor is safe from Martin's pen. The reputation is not unwarranted; of the 916 named characters that populate Martin's world, a third have died, alongside uncounted nameless ones. 

The shiny app is deployed [here](https://renshou753.shinyapps.io/thrones)

This analysis is inspired by Allen Downey' Bayesian survival analysis for Game of Thrones, relevant data are available from [here](https://github.com/benkahle/bayesianGameofThrones)
